<h2>Making Bread</h2> <p>Combine 3 parts flour with 2 parts water to get 5 parts of pure dough.</p> <p>From there, you can either <b>cut it</b>, <b>bake</b> or <b>flatten</b> it.</p>

<p>When it comes to <b>cutting</b>, you can cut pieces as much as you want as long as total parts <b>equals 10</b>.</p>

<p>If you bake dough, it will turn into white bread which you can <b>cut</b> into burger buns.</p>

<p>If you bake dough with <b>30 or more</b> parts dough, it will turn into a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>If you bake flat dough, it will turn into flat dough which you can <b>cut</b> into flat bread. Note: the amount of parts doesn't seem to matter here.</p>
