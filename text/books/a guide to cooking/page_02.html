<h2>The Making Of A Chef</h2>
<p>So you wanna get cookin'n'grubbin' like a refined gentleman huh?</p>
<p>Well, you better put your back into it because cooking is a deep, intricate science passed down across the ages, a path only a few chosen ones may take... Will you have what it takes to prove yourself?! Dramatics aside, there are some rules you need to follow.</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>First and foremost, you must be kind to your food. Have the <b>intent</b> to make something out of it, not <b>smash</b> it to pieces. Wouldn't wanna spill a smoothie you just made all over yourself, would ya now? Second, always be equipped, whether it's a bowl to make some dough or smash some eggs in, or even a mighty fine zweihander to cut a bun in half. Anything will do really but the essential is a sharp tool to <b>cut</b> things with, then something to <b>flatten</b> but hopefully you still have hands. Maybe. Spare beakers, grinding tools, bowls, even syringes are good to have. One last thing is that food truly is science, if you want to make perfection that is. You can follow the recipe closely, however <b>experimenting</b> can help immensely, adjusting the doses, injecting random stuff or adding spices in the dish can affect the result, like adding more water when making dough, you'll have perfect hydrating dough even if it most likely tastes weird but hey science is science.</p>

<h2>"Oops I Left The Oven On"</h2>
<p>No matter what you do, do <b>NOT</b> leave something burning on that grill or oven or whatever the hell you're using. It ruins the dish! Also possibly may get you torn to pieces after a while for <b>culinary crimes</b> but that's just a detail. No burning shit unless really needed, okay?</p>
